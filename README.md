# error-with-tkinter-filedialog
Firstly I would like to say hello!

I would like someone to give me a hand.
I'm new in GitHub community and I hope one day I'll help someone.
I started learning python about 2 months ago and I can't solve the problem below.
While I'm running the program the error appears:

Qt: Untested Windows version 10.0 detected!
log4cplus:ERROR No appenders could be found for logger (AdSyncNamespace).
log4cplus:ERROR Please initialize the log4cplus system properly.

Program is still running but doesn't work properly.
I found information that it can be caused by autodesk, but I don't want sacrefice it.
Any Ideas guys?
