# error-with-tkinter-filedialog
I can't sole the problem:
Firstly I would like to say hello!
I'm new in GitHub community.
I would like someone to give me a hand.
While I'm running the program the error appears:

Program is still running but doesn't work properly.
I found information that it can be caused by autodesk, but I don't want sacrefice it.
Any Ideas guys?
